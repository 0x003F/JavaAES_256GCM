This is a Java class that performs the encryption of a string using the AES-256 GCM algorithm.

I wrote this class modifying the code provided by Bharath R. on his specific article on Medium (https://medium.com/@bh03051999/aes-gcm-encryption-and-decryption-for-python-java-and-typescript-562dcaa96c22).

The class provides two static methods to obtain the cyphered or decyphered string passing to them the respective string and the masterkey.
It also provides the necessary methods and constructors to cypher or decypher a message using the JavaAES_256GCM object.
